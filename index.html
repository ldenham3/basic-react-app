generic react app, comments under each line to clairify purpose. I know it makes it ugly sorry. 

<body>
	<div id="root"></div>
	<!-- where the application is mounted -->

	<script type="text/javascript">


		const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
		// how we get access to the root div above, create variable and get the element by id we want

		const element = document.createElement('div')
		// variable element that contains things we want appended to the root. can create elements with createElement then the type, this one is a div

		element.textContent = 'Hello World'
		// adding text content to the element div

		element.className = 'container'
		// because why not? idk he said just for fun. I assume its so we can use a class name for the element div elsewhere

		rootElement.appendChild(element)
		// appending the element variable as the child of the root

	</script>
</body>
